# Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Data

This repository contains code and analysis for a simple machine learning project to classify human activities using smartphone sensor data.

## Dataset 

The dataset is from [1] (Reyes-Ortiz,Jorge, Anguita,Davide, Ghio,Alessandro, Oneto,Luca, and Parra,Xavier. (2012). Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C54S4K.). 
It contains recordings of 30 participants performing activities of daily living while carrying smartphones.
